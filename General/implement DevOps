According to me, the most important thing that DevOps helps us achieve is to get the changes into production as quickly as possible 
while minimizing risks in software quality assurance and compliance.
 For example, clearer communication and better working relationships between teams 
 i.e. both the Ops team and Dev team collaborate together to deliver good quality software which in turn leads to higher customer satisfaction.
